# things to consider:
# * what happens when a user is marked as not reviewed?
#  * does this signal user deletion? Or does literal Townie deletion signal
#    "needs to be removed from disk"? I think it makes the most sense for the
#    latter to imply full user deletion.
#  * I honestly can't even think of a reason to revert a user to "not reviewed"
#    and perhaps it's best to just not make that possible. for now, though, I
#    think I can ignore it.
# * what happens when a user needs to be banned?
#  * the Townie should be deleted via post_delete signal

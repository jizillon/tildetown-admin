hi!

you requested a new username on tilde.town. This process required logging you
out and killing any active processes you had running. sorry if this caused any
confusion or inconvenience.

old username: {{old_username}}
new username: {{new_username}}

you'll use this when ssh'ing into the town.

best,
~vilmibm
